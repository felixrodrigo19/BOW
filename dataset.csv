Please allow me to introduce myself,2
I'm a man of wealth and taste,2
I've been around for long long years,2
Stole many a man's soul and faith,2
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ,2
Had his moment of doubt and pain,2
Made damn sure that Pilate,2
Washed his hands and sealed his fate,2
Pleased to meet you,2
Hope you guess my name,2
But what's puzzling you,2
Is the nature of my game,2
I stuck around St. Petersburg,2
When I saw it was a time for a change,2
Killed the czar and his ministers,2
Anastasia screamed in vain,2
I rode a tank,2
Held a general's rank,2
When the blitzkrieg raged,2
And the bodies stank,2
Pleased to meet you,2
Hope you guess my name,2
But what's puzzling you,2
Is the nature of my game,2
I watched with glee,2
While your kings and queens,2
Fought for ten decades,2
For the gods they made,2
I shouted out,2
Who killed the Kennedys?,2
When after all,2
It was you and me,2
Let me please introduce myself,2
I'm a man of wealth and taste,2
And I laid traps for troubadours,2
Who get killed before they reached Bombay,2
Pleased to meet you,2
Hope you guessed my name,2
But what's puzzling you,2
Is the nature of my game,2
"Get down, baby",2
Pleased to meet you,2
Hope you guessed my name,2
But what's confusing you,2
Is just the nature of my game,2
Just as every cop is a criminal,2
And all the sinners saints,2
As heads is tails,2
Just call me Lucifer,2
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint,2
So if you meet me,2
Have some courtesy,2
"Have some sympathy, and some taste",2
Use all your well-learned politesse,2
Or I'll lay your soul to waste,2
Pleased to meet you,2
Hope you guessed my name,2
But what's puzzling you,2
Is the nature of my game,2
Get down,2
"Tell me baby, what's my name",2
"Tell me honey, can ya guess my name",2
"Tell me baby, what's my name",2
"I tell you one time, you're to blame",2
What's my name,2
"Tell me, baby, what's my name",2
"Tell me, sweetie, what's my name",2
When I find myself in times of trouble,1
Mother Mary comes to me,1
Speaking words of wisdom,1
Let it be,1
And in my hour of darkness,1
She is standing right in front of me,1
Speaking words of wisdom,1
Let it be,1
"Let it be, let it be",1
"Let it be, let it be",1
Whisper words of wisdom,1
Let it be,1
And when all the broken hearted people,1
Living in the world agree,1
There will be an answer,1
Let it be,1
For though they may be parted there is,1
Still a chance that they will see,1
There will be an answer,1
Let it be,1
"Let it be, let it be",1
"Let it be, let it be",1
There will be an answer,1
Let it be,1
"Let it be, let it be",1
"Let it be, let it be",1
Whisper words of wisdom,1
Let it be,1
"Let it be, let it be",1
"Let it be, let it be",1
Whisper words of wisdom,1
Let it be,1
And when the night is cloudy,1
There is still a light that shines on me,1
Shine on until tomorrow,1
Let it be,1
I wake up to the sound of music,1
Mother Mary comes to me,1
Speaking words of wisdom,1
Let it be,1
"Let it be, let it be",1
"Let it be, let it be",1
There will be an answer,1
Let it be,1
Yesterday,1
All my troubles seemed so far away,1
Now it looks as though they're here to stay,1
"Oh, I believe in yesterday",1
Suddenly,1
I'm not half the man I used to be,1
There's a shadow hanging over me,1
"Oh, yesterday came suddenly",1
Why she had to go I don't know,1
She wouldn't say,1
I said something wrong now I long,1
For yesterday,1
Yesterday,1
Love was such an easy game to play,1
Now I need a place to hide away,1
"Oh, I believe in yesterday",1
Why she had to go I don't know,1
She wouldn't say,1
I said something wrong now I long,1
For yesterday,1
I can't get no satisfaction,2
I can't get no satisfaction,2
"'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try",2
I can't get no,2
I can't get no,2
When I'm drivin' in my car,2
And that man comes on the radio,2
He's tellin' me more and more,2
About some useless information,2
Supposed to drive my imagination,2
I can't get no,2
"Oh, no, no, no",2
"Hey, hey, hey",2
That's what I say,2
I can't get no satisfaction,2
I can't get no satisfaction,2
"'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try",2
I can't get no,2
I can't get no,2
When I'm watchin' my TV,2
And that man comes on to tell me,2
How white my shirts can be,2
"But he can't be a man, 'cause he doesn't smoke",2
The same cigarettes as me,2
I can't get no,2
"Oh, no, no, no",2
"Hey, hey, hey",2
That's what I say,2
I can't get no satisfaction,2
I can't get no girl reaction,2
"'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try",2
I can't get no,2
I can't get no,2
When I'm ridin' round the world,2
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that,2
And I'm tryin' to make some girl,2
"Who tells me, baby, better come back later next week",2
'Cause you see I'm on losing streak,2
I can't get no,2
"Oh, no, no, no",2
"Hey, hey, hey",2
That's what I say,2
I can't get no,2
I can't get no,2
I can't get no satisfaction,2
No satisfaction,2
No satisfaction,2
No satisfaction,2
I can't get no,2
